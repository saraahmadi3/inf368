The code for problem assignment 5 relies both on custom code. The environment has been tested and run on different architectures, but if you find problem with rendering, please get in touch with the TA Morten Bl√∏rstad.


## Instantiating the *cookiedisaster* environment

In order to setup the *cookiedisaster* environment,  you will have to perform the following steps:
1. Unzip *cookiedisaster.zip*
2. Move into the directory containing the *cookiedisaster/* folder
3. From the prompt, run the command  ```pip install -e cookiedisaster```

You will then be able to instantiate the environment as:
```
import gymnasium
import cookiedisaster

env = gymnasium.make('cookiedisaster/GridWorld-v0')
```
You can then interact with the environment *env* as a standard *gymnasium* environment.
